        <p>Cat Paris (They/Them) is an educator and linocut artist living in the New York Area. She is an active member of Hack Manhattan and a supporter of NYC Resistor.

            These linocut prints depict 2 of New York City’s most famous birds.
            
            Pale Male was a red tailed hawk who moved to the city in the 1990s. He built his nest in a building on the Upper West Side of central park. His landlord attempted to evict him in 2004 by installing pigeon spikes on the building’s facade, but several neighbors—including local birdwatchers, members of the Audubon Society and Emmy Award winning actress Mary Tyler Moore—rallied on Pale Male’s behalf, thus thwarting the landlord’s nefarious scheme. 
            Pale Male went on to rule as New York’s raptor overlord for 19 more glorious years, before dying of old age in 2023. He is survived by a dynasty of red-tailed hawks that can be found in green spaces across the city to this day. 
            
            Flaco was a eurasian eagle owl who was let out of the Central Park Zoo by some hooligans and spent one glorious year living on the Lower East Side before passing away in 2024 after flying into a window. Though his reign as one of the city’s Ruling Raptors was short, he is fondly remembered. It is said that when the moon is full and the park is quiet, you can see his ghost flying through the trees near the Harlem Meer.
